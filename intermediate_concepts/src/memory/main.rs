/*
Memory is stored using binary
+ Bits: 0 or 1
Computer optmized for bytes
+ 1 byte = 8 contiguous bits
Fully contiguous
*/

/*
All data is memory has an 'address'
+ Used to locate data
+ Always the same -- only data changes
Usually don't utilize addresses directly
+ Variables handle most of the work
*/

/* Memory offsets
Items can be located at an address using an 'offset'
Offsets being at 0
Represent the number of bytes away from the original address
+ Normally deal with indexes instead
